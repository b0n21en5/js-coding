# Debounce and Throttling

### Debouncing and throttling are programming techniques, not features or built-in functionalities of programming languages or libraries. They are used to control the rate at which a function is called in response to events, such as user interactions or continuous triggers.

### These techniques are commonly applied in front-end web development to improve performance and optimize user experience. Both techniques are used to prevent excessive function calls and reduce unnecessary processing, particularly when dealing with events that can fire rapidly.
